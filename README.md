# Mental Health in workplace analysis
Analysis of a survey dataset on mental health to understand factors influencing treatment-seeking behavior.

## Overview
The Mental Health Workplace Analysis project aims to explore various factors related to mental health in the workplace through data analysis. The dataset used in this project contains responses from individuals regarding their mental health status, workplace environment, and attitudes towards seeking treatment.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, features, and data quality.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, cleaning, and transforming data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis of different aspects related to mental health in the workplace, including the prevalence of mental health conditions, factors influencing treatment-seeking behavior, and the impact of workplace environment.
- **Modeling**: Building predictive models to understand the factors influencing the likelihood of seeking treatment for mental health issues.
- **Results and Insights**: Summarizing key findings and insights obtained from the analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Details
- **Data Source**: This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. [Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/data).
- **Data Cleaning**: Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Extensive exploration of various factors related to mental health in the workplace, including demographics, family history, work interference, and company policies.
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models were built to predict the likelihood of seeking treatment for mental health issues based on various features.
- **Insights**: Key insights include the prevalence of mental health conditions among respondents, the impact of family history on treatment-seeking behavior, and the influence of workplace policies on mental health outcomes.
